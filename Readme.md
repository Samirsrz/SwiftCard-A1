1) Null is defined by the developer... if we cant find a value of something we defined it as null that means its value is empty, there  is no value
   but Undefined is when we declare a variable but dont assign a value . 
   example: let a; console.log(a) -> it will give undefined
            let a=null console.log(a) -> it will give null

2) map() returns a new array by transofrminf the old array of same length
   but forEach() doesnt return anything or any value


3) == means we are checking the value of the variable are equal or not but === mean we are checking both the value and the type of the variable
   example: 44=='44' it will return the condition as true beacause it only comparees the values but 44==='44' will return false as the type of the variables are not same ,
   one is integer and the othe one is string


4) We use async/await when we write functions to load data.. it is better to use because it holds the executiong of the next lines of code till the data is loaded,
   await pauses the execution of codes related to the data so that it doenst throw error


5) GLOBAL-SCOPE: The variable declared in the global scope can be changed and accessed from anywhere of the file
   FUNCTIONAL-SCOPE: The avriabls can only be accessed inside the function for work but cannot be accessed from outside of the function.
   BLOCK-SCOPE: Block scope means variables declared inside {} like in if{ } are only accessible inside that block.
